# Landing Page Project

## Project Description

Its a landing page with 4 sections, a navbar and a basic footer. 

## Usage

I wanted to use this as a way to learn more about formatting & dynamics, in a way that I'd be able to use for my music project. So, the 4 sections on the page have a song title, a blurb of what the song is about, and a scrollable section to be able to read the lyrics of the song. Further things I would add if I had more time, would probably be space for some visual elements (videos or images) and probably some links where you could listen to the songs.
