                    <h2>Kissing In Public</h2>
                    <p class="blurb">I wrote this song in early 2020. For me it's about that feeling when you're in a new relationship, where you are just completely obsessed with the other person and can't bear the thought of not being with them. That often irrational 'all in' feeling.</p>

                        <p>I’ve become accustomed to kissing in public<br>
                        Holding hands when it’s too hot to breathe<br>
                        Mundane with her is magic<br>
                        My heart keeps spilling out words<br>
                        I want to kiss her in the line for coffee</p>
                        <p>
                        And I just saw a girl with her hair outside my window<br>
                        It wasn't her but I wanted it to be<br>
                        Somehow even though I saw her yesterday<br>
                        I'm scared to text her<br>
                        Scared to annoy her away from me</p>
                        <p>
                        I think my mother is internally screaming at me<br>
                        I've got a one way ticket, 12 hours on the train line<br>
                        I've been waiting waiting waiting waiting<br>
                        With records and reading to pass the time</p>
                        <p>
                        Oh God she has the cutest birthmark on her shoulder<br>
                        Let me dive in, sweep me away with the tide<br>
                        I keep thinking that I'll run out of words to say<br>
                        Been talking shit all of my life waiting to find</p>
                        <p>
                        Her</p>
                        <p>
                        She's all the poetry I could ever read<br>
                        Standing in front of me</p>
                        <p>
                        I’ve become accustomed to kissing in public<br>
                        Holding hands when it’s too hot to breathe<br>
                        Mundane with her is magic<br>
                        My heart keeps spilling out words<br>
                        I want to kiss her in the line for coffee</p>
                        <p>
                        I've become accustomed<br>
                        I've become accustomed to kissing in public</p>

                    <p class="blurb">This song is about a tipping point for me, a moment of clarity. It tells the story of that short lived love, when you meet someone perfect and you know that you'll never see them again, but also that you'll be thinking of them for the rest of your life.</p>

                        waiting, passing time<br>
                        unknown city, different life<br>
                        lukewarm coffee<br>
                        talk to strangers to get by<br>
                        oh I know i am alone<br>
                        but i feel at home<br>
                        before i even meet your eyes</p>
                        <p>
                        temporary friends<br>
                        I hope that's not you and i <br>
                        crushed together in a room<br>
                        filled with people and flashing lights<br>
                        oh the way you have bewitched me <br>
                        as you tell me about your life<br>
                        and in the minutes i cant hear you<br>
                        i feel your hand against my thigh</p>
                        <p>
                        and the small of my back<br>
                        you send shivers up my spine<br>
                        i cant stand to leave this moment <br>
                        i cant stand you're not mine<br>
                        i wanna beg you to join me <br>
                        run away from our lives<br>
                        live forever in the forest <br>
                        refuse to adhere to time</p>
                        <p>
                        the city is so cold now<br>
                        the heat dispersed with the crowd<br>
                        you're smoking a cigarette<br>
                        and I wish I knew how<br>
                        but the clock keeps on ticking<br>
                        our moments coming to an end<br>
                        put a kiss on my cheek<br>
                        i wish I'd turned my head<br>
                        felt your lips on mine</p>
                        <p>
                        and the small of my back<br>

                        sometimes my fingertips arent good enough <br>
                        textures feel better when i brush em against my lips<br>
                        and i prefer my tea in the summer<br>
                        in air conned rooms where the heat always escapes me<br>
                        i think i see the world a little differently<br>
                        train tracks & jet packs are the soundtrack of my dreams<br>
                        i’m a little too affected by what i see on tv <br>
                        my friends hang on my wall to remind me <br>
                        that i <br>
                        am a subject of humanity<br>
                        a chapter of reality<br>
                        and i’m still tryna wrap my head around it </p>
                        <p>
                        i’ve told my friends i dont think i’ll make it to 30<br>
                        i’m not suicidal i just dont think it exists<br>
                        i have a problem where if i cant imagine it i wont do it<br>
                        and sorry mum but i cant imagine having kids<br>
                        oh i think i see things differently <br>
                        the best thing about that kiss was the look on his face<br>
                        and the best wine i’ve ever had was a four dollar bottle of gossips<br>
                        but i play board games with my friends and they remind me that i<br>
                        am subject to them loving me<br>
                        am a chapter in our legacy<br>
                        and i’m still tryna wrap my head around it </p>
                        <p>
                        i dont know why people live <br>
                        and at this point i’m too scared to ask<br>
                        too many nights thinking about death<br>
                        i hope this feeling doesnt last<br>
                        i dont know why people live <br>

                        too many nights staring at the ceiling <br>

                        my eyes are carrying the moon<br>
                        the whole world asleep<br>
                        in a sea of blacky blue<br>
                        i’ll have a coffee or two<br>
                        the lights are softer at four am<br>
                        than when i’m with you</p>
                        <p>
                        my legs are cold but i’ll keep my fan on<br>
                        summers on its way with heat unheard of<br>
                        that heat is loud, but the night is silent<br>
                        in its wisdom<br>
                        i’ll probably fall asleep when the sun comes up</p>
                        <p>
                        but about you<br>
                        i feel like i have something to say<br>
                        but my tongue wont form it<br>
                        just enjoy yourself anyway<br>
                        i dont know if, i’ll<br>
                        make it to tomorrow day</p>
                        <p>
                        sometimes silence is my best friend<br>
                        but tonight i hear the whispers <br>
                        and i want it to end<br>
                        cant remember the last book i read<br>
                        dont let my brain turn to mush<br>
                        oh you’re my only friend </p>
                        <p>
                        but about you<br>
                        i feel like i have something to say<br>
                        but my tongue wont form it<br>
                        just enjoy yourself anyway<br>

                        <p>
                        i give you love, and in return i’m confused<br>
                        how many times do i have to say<br>
                        i wish i never kissed you</p>
                        <p>
                        history has been my teacher <br>
                        but i havent been listening</p>
                        <p>
                        i wish i wasn’t writing this song<br>
                        but i wish there wasn’t anything wrong<br>
                        with us
